# windows-text-file-extensions - a comprehensive list of Windows-centric text file extensions

A repository of file extensions that can reasonably be assumed to be Windows-centric text files (that should probably use CRLF line endings).

# The List

[windows-text-file-extensions.txt](https://github.com/mcandre/windows-text-file-extensions/blob/master/conf/windows-text-file-extensions.txt)

# Format

* One file extension per line.
* Lowercase.
* Basename of extension (omit the dot `.`).

# Things that should NOT be in the list

`txt`, `xml`, and other formats not specific to Windows or other Microsoft systems should be omitted.
